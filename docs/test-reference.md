## E2E Tests

*Note: No Cypress E2E tests have been implemented yet. Consider adding these for full workflow testing.*

## Test Coverage Gaps

The following areas would benefit from additional test coverage:

1. **E2E Workflow Tests**: Complete end-to-end tests using Cypress for full user flows
2. **Streak Calculation Edge Cases**: Additional tests for workout streak logic corner cases
3. **Mobile-specific Behaviors**: More thorough testing of mobile-specific features
4. **Error Recovery Scenarios**: Tests for error recovery paths, especially network issues
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Tests to verify accessibility compliance

## Troubleshooting Common Test Issues

### 1. Wake Lock API Testing

For tests involving the Wake Lock API:
- Ensure proper mocking in `jest.setup.js`
- Use `await act()` when testing wake lock requests
- Consider skipping on CI environments where Wake Lock API mocking may be problematic

### 2. Audio Unlocking Tests

For tests involving audio unlocking:
- Create a separate test environment for mobile device simulation
- Consider using dependency injection for easier mocking
- Extract audio unlock logic into a separate hook for better testability

### 3. Workout Timer Tests

For workout timer tests:
- Use `jest.useFakeTimers()` consistently
- Be cautious with rapid timer advancements
- Mock audio to prevent playback issues
- Consider separating state logic for better unit testing

### 4. React State Update Warnings

To resolve "not wrapped in act()" warnings:
- Wrap state updates in `act()`
- Use `await waitFor()` for asynchronous state changes
- Consider refactoring components to have more predictable state updates

## Refactoring Plans

The following components have been identified for refactoring to improve testability:

### AudioUnlocker Refactoring

Planned improvements:
- Extract audio unlock logic into a custom hook (`useAudioUnlock`)
- Implement dependency injection for easier testing
- Add data-testid attributes to key elements
- Create test-specific props for controlling component state

### WorkoutTimer Refactoring

Planned improvements:
- Extract workout state management into a custom hook (`useWorkoutState`)
- Break down the component into smaller, more testable sub-components
- Create explicit phases (ready, active, complete) for clearer testing
- Add data-testid attributes to all important UI elements

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Component | Target Date | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Extract custom hooks | Apr 30, 2023 | üîÑ In Progress |
| 2 | Update test infrastructure | May 5, 2023 | üìÖ Planned |
| 3 | Refactor components | May 15, 2023 | üìÖ Planned |
| 4 | Add E2E tests | May 30, 2023 | üìÖ Planned |
