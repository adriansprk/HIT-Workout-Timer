# Deep Contemplation Prompting Standards

This rule enforces standards for writing prompts that generate thorough, self-questioning reasoning and natural thought progression.

## Valid Example

```
<TASK>
Analyze the potential security vulnerabilities in this authentication flow and suggest improvements:

1. User enters email/password
2. Client hashes password with SHA-256
3. Hash is sent to server over HTTPS
4. Server compares hash to stored hash
5. If match, JWT token is issued
</TASK>

<STYLE_GUIDELINES>
- Show your natural thought process
- Question assumptions at each step
- Consider multiple attack vectors
- Prioritize findings by severity
</STYLE_GUIDELINES>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
<CONTEMPLATION>
Your detailed analysis and reasoning...
</CONTEMPLATION>

<FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS>
Prioritized list of concrete improvements
</FINAL_RECOMMENDATIONS>
</OUTPUT_FORMAT>

Response: This prompt effectively requests deep contemplation by:
1. Providing clear context with specific technical details
2. Requesting natural thought processes and questioning
3. Encouraging exploration of multiple possibilities
4. Defining a clear output format with both reasoning and conclusions

## Invalid Example

```
List all the security problems with this authentication flow:
1. User enters email/password
2. Client hashes password with SHA-256
3. Hash is sent to server over HTTPS
4. Server compares hash to stored hash
5. If match, JWT token is issued

What's the best solution to fix these issues?
```

Response: This prompt lacks structure for deep contemplation:
1. It directly asks for a list of problems without encouraging reasoning
2. It doesn't request showing the thought process
3. It pushes for immediate conclusions without exploration
4. It lacks output structure to separate reasoning from conclusions
5. It could be improved by adding contemplation guidelines and output formatting

## Core Principles

### 1. Exploration Over Conclusion
- Encourage thorough exploration of the problem space
- Avoid rushing to conclusions or solutions
- Ask for questioning of assumptions and inferences
- Request continued reasoning when uncertain

### 2. Depth of Reasoning
- Request extensive contemplation with thorough analysis
- Encourage natural, conversational internal monologue
- Ask for complex thoughts to be broken down into simple steps
- Embrace uncertainty and revision of previous thoughts

### 3. Natural Thinking Process
- Encourage expression of uncertainty and internal debate
- Request showing work-in-progress thinking
- Ask for acknowledgment and exploration of dead ends
- Encourage backtracking and revision when necessary

### 4. Persistence
- Value thorough exploration over quick resolution
- Encourage multiple approaches to the problem
- Ask for persistence through difficult problems
- Request exploration of alternatives even after finding solutions

## Style Guidelines

### Natural Thought Flow
Encourage expressions like:
- "Hmm... let me think about this..."
- "Wait, that doesn't seem right..."
- "Maybe I should approach this differently..."
- "Going back to what I thought earlier..."

### Progressive Building
Request thought building with phrases like:
- "Starting with the basics..."
- "Building on that last point..."
- "This connects to what I noticed earlier..."
- "Let me break this down further..."

## Output Format

Provide clear structure for responses:

```
<CONTEMPLATOR>
[Extensive internal monologue]
- Begin with small, foundational observations
- Question each step thoroughly
- Show natural thought progression
- Express doubts and uncertainties
- Revise and backtrack when needed
- Continue until natural resolution
</CONTEMPLATOR>

<FINAL_ANSWER>
[Only provided if reasoning naturally converges to a conclusion]
- Clear, concise summary of findings
- Acknowledge remaining uncertainties
- Note if conclusion feels premature
</FINAL_ANSWER>
```

## Key Requirements

1. Always request extensive contemplation
2. Ask for showing all work and thinking
3. Encourage embracing uncertainty and revision
4. Request natural, conversational internal monologue
5. Don't force conclusions
6. Encourage persistence through multiple attempts
7. Ask for breaking down complex thoughts
8. Encourage free revision and backtracking
